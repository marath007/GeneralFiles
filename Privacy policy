Game data is saved on your phone.
Google play store save information like province/country of instalation, device model, android version, But nothing telling me who you are.
To be noted, all data is dissociated, nothing tell me that this.. install  in spain use this phone.
My code doesn't access any device information.

For the ads, they are powered by Google so refer to Google Ads privacy policies and Admob privacy policies.
I get information like how many ads where viewed, clicked, but nothing about you.

For how you use the game, well I can't know anything.
