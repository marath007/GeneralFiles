The game analyse the audio volume and doesn't save any of it.
all audio data is destroyed after being processed 60 times per seconds.

Other than that game data is saved on your phone.
Google play store save information like country of instalation, device model, android version, but nothing telling me who you are.

My code doesn't access any device information.

For the ads, they are powered by Google so refer to Google Ads privacy policies and Admob privacy policies.
I get information like how many ads where viewed, clicked, but nothing about you.

For how you use the game, well all I know is what you tell me!
